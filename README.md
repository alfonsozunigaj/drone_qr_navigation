# Drone QR Navigation
## Environment setup

Assuming you already have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) installed on your computer, follow this instructions to set up the virtual environment for the project. Open the command prompt and navigate to the project's directory. Then, run the following commands:
```
conda create -n drone python=3.6
conda activate drone
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Here we have created a virtual python environment called "drone", where we've installed all the required libraries needed for the project to run.
